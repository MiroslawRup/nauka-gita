      <h1>Taarlo</h1>
      <p>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.</p>
      <p>And in spring too I feel no different.</p>
      <p>We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves</p>
      <p>through much dark-red loss, <i>appellation control√©e</i>,</p>
        <br>
      <p>that deepens in the cellar of the years.</p>
      <p>We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.</p>
      <p>Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees</p>
      <p>sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.</p>
        <br>
      <p>33, and in the midst of the dark wood</p>
      <p>of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,</p>
      <p>at home in the woods and desolate at home.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Will we one day, maybe, ever?</p>
      <p>The summer is past, the hay-making is over.</p>
      <p>The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</p>
